# Google Software Engineer Preparation

This repository tracks my progress and plan for preparing to apply for a Software Engineer role at Google.

## Goal

My primary goal is to be ready to apply for a Software Engineer position at Google within the next six months.

## Approach

I am using a Kanban-style GitHub Project Board to organize my learning and preparation tasks. Each Epic and Story/Task from my plan is represented as a GitHub Issue, allowing me to track my progress through "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns on the Project Board. Labels are used to categorize issues by month, topic (Coding, System Design, Behavioral, Resume), and specific skills.

## Repository Structure

* **Issues:** Each preparation task is created as a GitHub Issue with detailed information, acceptance criteria, resources, and estimated effort.
* **Project Board:** The "Project" tab provides a visual Kanban board to track the status of each issue.

## Current Status

[You can add a brief sentence here about your current stage, e.g., "Currently in Month 1 focusing on foundational Java and basic DSA."]

## How to Use This Repository (For My Own Tracking)

1.  **Issues:** I will be creating and updating issues based on my preparation plan.
2.  **Project Board:** I will use the Project Board to move issues between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns as I work through the plan.
3.  **Labels:** I will utilize labels to filter and categorize tasks.

## Future Plans (Optional)

* Potentially add code snippets of implemented algorithms.
* Link to relevant learning resources directly within the issues or the README.
* Include notes and summaries of key concepts learned.
